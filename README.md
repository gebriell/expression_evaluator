# Object-Oriented Calculator with GUI

## Overview

This repository houses a Java-based project that demonstrates object-oriented principles in the development of a calculator application. It comprises two primary components:

Expression Evaluator: An object capable of parsing and computing mathematical expressions.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): A user-friendly interface for interacting with the expression evaluator.
## Key Features

# Object-Oriented Design:
Leverages an operator superclass, extended by classes representing specific operators (+, -, *, /, ^).
Employs an operand class to handle numerical inputs and parsing.
# Expression Parsing:
Divides expressions into operands and operators using delimiters.
# Mathematical Calculations:
Performs arithmetic operations based on parsed expressions.
# User-Friendly GUI:
Provides a visual interface for input and output.
# Extensibility:
Designed for potential expansion with additional operators and features.
## Setup and Usage

Clone this repository.
Open the project in a Java IDE.
Compile and run the CalculatorGUI.java file.
## Future Enhancements

Implement additional operators (e.g., parentheses, square root).
Support decimal numbers.
Add error handling for invalid expressions.
Explore alternative GUI frameworks for visual customization.
## Contributions

Your contributions and feedback are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
